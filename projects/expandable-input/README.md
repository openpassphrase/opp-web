# Expandable Input - CDK

## What is it?
A component consisting of a trigger element (button/icon/anything else...) and an input which shows by sliding to the left when the button is clicked.

Both, the trigger element and the input need to be supplied allowing a lot of flexibility. This library strives to make as little assumptions about styling as possible. It is then very simple to use this as a base for 

Optionally you can also pass an "action trigger" element, which is useful when you'd like the user to be able to submit the value via a button.

## What does it look like?
Code:
```html
<cdk-expandable-input>
  <input type="text" cdkExpInput />
  <i cdkExpIconOpen>üîç</i>
  <i cdkExpIconClose>‚úñÔ∏è</i>
</cdk-expandable-input>

<br />

<cdk-expandable-input>
  <input type="text" cdkExpInput />
  <i cdkExpIconOpen>‚ûï</i>
  <i cdkExpIconClose>‚úñÔ∏è</i>
  <i cdkExpIconAction>‚ûï</i>
</cdk-expandable-input>
```

@Input() slideToEdge = false; | Used when `[right]="is greater than 0"`. Animates component to take the whole container's width when extending
@Input() group: string | If multiple components use the same value for "group" input, only one component with that group value can be expanded at a time
@Input() actionOffset = 5; | Sets how far to the left from the open/close elements the action element is.
@Input() blurInputOnEsc = false; | When true, input looses focus if Esc is pressed
